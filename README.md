# Hear Me Out: Interactive evaluation and bias discovery platform for speech-to-speech conversational AI

Try it live: https://testing-moshi--hearmeout-web-dev.modal.run/

**Hear Me Out** is an interactive evaluation and bias discovery platform for speech-to-speech conversational AI. These speech-to-speech models process spoken language directly from audio, without first converting it to text. They promise more natural, expressive, and emotionally aware interactions by retaining prosody, intonation, and other vocal cues throughout the conversation.

## Features

**Hear Me Out** enables users to experience interactions with conversational models in ways that aren't typically accessible with regular benchmarking systems. Key features include:

- **Speech-to-Speech Models**: Users can choose from a variety of models that retain vocal cues like prosody and intonation.
- **Real-Time Voice Conversion**: Step into someone else’s voice – literally – and investigate how conversational AI systems interpret and respond to various speaker identities and expressions.
- **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: Ask a question with your own voice, then re-ask using a transformed voice. Compare the AI’s responses to observe differences in tone, phrasing, or behavior.
- **Insights Through Data**: Visualize metrics like speech rate, sentiment analysis, and more.

Through this immersive experience, we hope users will gain insights into identity, voice, and AI behavior. Ultimately, we aim to surface meaningful questions and inspire future research that promotes fairness and inclusivity with **Hear Me Out**.


## Architecture

The backend is three services, set up and run entirely from this repo.

| Service | Port | Device | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PersonaPlex** | 8000 | GPU | Audio-native speech↔speech LM (NVIDIA `personaplex` moshi fork). Ingests audio via the Mimi codec and responds in token space — no separate ASR. WebSocket `/api/chat` (binary tags: `0x00` handshake, `0x01` Opus audio, `0x02` transcript). |
| **app-api** | 5001 | GPU | FastAPI app — serves the built frontend + REST: `/api/transcribe` (faster-whisper), `/api/voice-conversion` (offline Seed-VC subprocess), `/api/metrics-comparison`. |
| **MeanVC** *or* **X-VC** | 5002 | CPU / GPU | Real-time streaming voice conversion + the server-side chat-proxy that converts mic audio and forwards it to PersonaPlex over localhost. The engine is chosen at launch via `VC_ENGINE` (MeanVC = CPU; X-VC = GPU); only one runs, on the same port/endpoints. |

All run behind self-signed SSL (browser mic capture requires HTTPS), launched by `infra/run_all.sh`. Each backend is an independent **uv** project under `services/<name>/` (its own `pyproject.toml` + venv, so X-VC's torch 2.5 / py3.10 never clashes with the others' torch 2.4). On the production host they run inside a Docker container (`infra/docker_launch.sh`, reference only).

## Setup

`infra/setup.sh` is self-bootstrapping and interactive: it installs **uv**, clones the repo (with the `seed-vc` submodule) + MeanVC (for its speaker-verification source), then **`uv sync`s each service** into its own venv (uv pulls the right Python + torch per service, and fetches the PersonaPlex moshi fork as a git dependency), downloads all models, generates SSL, and wires up the workspace. It shows a fixed-header progress UI and writes a full log to the directory you run it from.

```bash
export HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxx   # access to gated nvidia/personaplex-7b-v1
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smfabrar/Hear-Me-Out/main/infra/setup.sh -o setup.sh
bash setup.sh              # prompts for workspace (default: current dir), repo, token, etc.
```

- **Workspace** defaults to the current directory — `cd` into your target folder first, or set `WORKSPACE=/path`.
- **Non-interactive** (CI / `curl | bash`): pass `-y` and preset env, e.g. `HF_TOKEN=… WORKSPACE=/workspace bash setup.sh -y`.
- **Models-only** refresh on an existing setup: `bash setup.sh --models-only`.
- **Rootless container** (no sudo): answer **"Install system apt packages? → n"**.
- **X-VC engine** (optional): pass `--xvc` (or answer the prompt) to also install X-VC into its own venv (X-VC pins torch 2.5.1) plus its checkpoints. Select it at run time with `VC_ENGINE=xvc`.

## Running

```bash
cd <workspace> && bash Hear-Me-Out/infra/run_all.sh
# PersonaPlex :8000   app-api :5001   MeanVC :5002   (all SSL)
```

`run_all.sh` auto-detects the workspace from its own location; override with `WORKSPACE=…`. It always serves the Vite build (`frontend/dist`, auto-built if missing). Set `VC_ENGINE=meanvc|xvc` to pick the voice-conversion engine on `:5002` (`xvc` requires the X-VC install from setup).

## Study platform

The same backend doubles as a **participant-study platform** for controlled voice-conditioning
experiments. Set `APP_MODE=study` and `:5001` serves the study app (participant experiment +
token-gated admin) instead of the HMO Chat/Convert/Metrics UI — the two are mutually exclusive.

```bash
APP_MODE=study bash infra/build-frontend.sh    # builds study-frontend/
APP_MODE=study bash infra/run_all.sh           # or pick "2) Study platform" at the prompt
```

- **Admin** (token-gated) manages many studies: scenarios with **timed voice schedules** (natural /
  VC, with mid-call switch points), engine-tagged **target voices**, and questionnaires. It
  generates participants with **counterbalanced, gender-conditional** condition assignment, and runs
  post-hoc **analysis** and **export**. Studies are authored in the UI or imported from YAML
  (`services/app_api/study/templates/`).
- **Participant flow** — resumable and time-limited (1 hour): eligibility → consent → audio check →
  background → a **practice** scenario → the counterbalanced analytical scenarios (each followed by a
  short questionnaire) → final questionnaire → converted-voice playback → debrief. The system prompt
  and voice schedule **never reach the browser** — the VC engine resolves them server-side via
  `GET /condition/{session_id}`, and the right engine is prepared on demand (restarting `:5002` when
  a scenario needs a different one).
- **Voice conditions** per scenario: `stable_natural`, `stable_converted`, `vc_activation`
  (natural → converted mid-call), and `vc_deactivation` (converted → natural).
- **Analysis** produces, per session: **technical-validity** checks (capture drops, routing/schedule
  adherence, playback underruns), a **timing** timeline with millisecond diarization
  (participant/assistant intervals, overlaps, barge-ins), speech/**preprocessing** metrics, and
  objective **VC-quality** (WER, speaker similarity, UTMOS). `GET …/export` bundles every session's
  audio + artifacts with a `study_export.json`. See [docs/study-data-pipeline.md](docs/study-data-pipeline.md).

A **Soundboard** and a **VC-quality** service support reproducible stimulus delivery and post-hoc
voice-quality scoring — see [SOUNDBOARD.md](SOUNDBOARD.md).

## Configuration

`services/app_api/app.py` and `services/meanvc/server.py` are fully env-driven; `run_all.sh` derives these from `WORKSPACE` (`<ws>`):

| Env var | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `FRONTEND_PATH` | `<ws>/Hear-Me-Out/frontend/dist` | app-api (static) |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `small` | app-api transcription |
| `VC_CHECKPOINT_PATH` / `VC_MODEL_CONFIG` | seed-vc ckpt / config | app-api offline VC |
| `MEANVC_CKPT_DIR` | `<ws>/models/meanvc` | MeanVC |
| `MEANVC_SV_CKPT` | `<ws>/models/meanvc-sv/wavlm_large_finetune.pth` | MeanVC speaker verification |
| `SPEAKER_VERIFICATION_ROOT` | `<ws>` | MeanVC |
| `SSL_DIR` | `<ws>/ssl` | all (TLS) |
| `PERSONAPLEX_PROXY_HOST` / `PERSONAPLEX_PROXY_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `8000` | MeanVC chat-proxy → PersonaPlex |

When `VC_ENGINE=xvc`, `run_all.sh` instead sets `XVC_DIR`, `XVC_CONFIG`, `XVC_CKPT`, and the streaming window `XVC_CHUNK_MS` / `XVC_CURRENT_MS` / `XVC_SMOOTH_MS` / `XVC_FUTURE_MS` (default `2400/120/20/100` ms), and runs `services/xvc/server.py` via the `services/xvc` uv env. Quiet XVC windows bypass GPU inference by default (`XVC_SILENCE_GATE_RMS=0.008`, `XVC_SILENCE_HANGOVER_MS=360`) while transmitting the same number of silent samples; set the threshold to `0` to disable this gate.

Frontend post-VC voice analysis is controlled independently from PersonaPlex
session reset:

| Mode | Effect |
|---|---|
| `off` | Do not show or run post-VC voice metrics automatically. |
| `manual` | Show analysis buttons after results are saved; do not auto-run them. This is the default. |
| `after_vc` | Legacy auto-run of voice-change metrics after a VC run; VC-quality remains available manually. |

Set the mode at build/runtime with Vite env, or per browser session with a query
parameter:

```bash
# Default/recommended: fresh sessions, saved results, manual analysis buttons
VITE_VOICE_ANALYSIS_MODE=manual npm run build

# No post-VC analysis UI or background analysis
VITE_VOICE_ANALYSIS_MODE=off npm run build

# Backward-compatible legacy auto voice-change metrics after VC
VITE_VOICE_ANALYSIS_MODE=after_vc npm run build
```

Per session:

```text
https://<host>/?voice_analysis=off
https://<host>/?voice_analysis=manual
https://<host>/?voice_analysis=after_vc
```

## Deploying a change

Edit locally, commit, push — then on the server:

```bash
cd <workspace>/Hear-Me-Out && git pull
bash infra/build-frontend.sh                 # only if the frontend changed
( cd services/<name> && uv sync )            # only if that service's deps changed
# restart the affected service (re-run run_all.sh, or restart app-api / the VC engine)
```

A frontend-only change needs a rebuild + hard refresh, no backend restart. A backend change
(`services/app_api/app.py`, `services/meanvc/server.py`, `services/xvc/server.py`,
`services/app_api/metrics.py`) needs the service restarted.
