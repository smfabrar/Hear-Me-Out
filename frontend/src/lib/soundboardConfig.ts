//  SOUNDBOARD CONFIG — single source of truth
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  EVERY audio constant the soundboard touches lives here. Do not hardcode
//  sample rates / channels / bit depths anywhere else. If PP's expected input
//  format changes, you change it HERE and only here.
//
//  CRITICAL — these MUST match what PersonaPlex expects on its WebSocket.
//  The live-mic path (useRecorder.ts) currently encodes Opus at 24000 Hz
//  mono with 80-sample frames, 1 frame per Ogg page. If you change PP_SAMPLE_RATE
//  here, make sure the live-mic encoder config in useRecorder.ts matches.
//
//  Verify end-to-end after any change:
//    1. Bake a known clip in VC mode (e.g. a 3.0s sine).
//    2. Run the bake again — output should be the same bytes (deterministic).
//    3. Compare X-Input-Duration-Ms vs X-Output-Duration-Ms response headers
//       — drift > DURATION_DRIFT_TOLERANCE_MS is a bug.
//    4. Play the slot through the conversation soundboard. Confirm PP responds
//       as if you'd spoken the same words live with VC off.
